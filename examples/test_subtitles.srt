Welcome to Undertext
A stenographic subtitle broadcasting system

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This subtitle is hidden in the VANC data
of the SDI video stream

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Only authorized devices can decrypt
and display these subtitles

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The data is encrypted using AES-256
and embedded in the least significant bits

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This provides secure, covert subtitle
broadcasting for sensitive applications

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Perfect for political events, court proceedings
or any scenario requiring discretion

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The system uses OAuth 2.0 PKCE for
secure device authentication

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Each session gets a unique decryption key
that expires after a set time period

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
